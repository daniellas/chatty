# Architecture

This is simple chat web application. It uses STOMP over WebSocket protocol for chat messages processing. I have choosen STOP protocol because it is supported  
out of the box by Spring Framework used as technology base. For more sophisticated use cases it would be worth to consider XMPP protocol but due to limited time
and bdudget it was much easier to use STOMP.
